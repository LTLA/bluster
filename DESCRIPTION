Title: Clustering Algorithms for Bioconductor
Description: 
    Wraps common clustering algorithms in an easily extended S4 framework.
    Backends are implemented for hierarchical, k-means and graph-based clustering.
    Several utilities are also provided to compare and evaluate clustering results.
