#' Create a graph between different clusterings
#'
#' Create a graph that links together clusters from different clusterings,
#' e.g., generated using different parameter settings or algorithms.
#' This is useful for identifying corresponding clusters between clusterings
#' and to create meta-clusters from multiple clusterings.
#'
#' @param clusters A list of factors or vectors where each entry corresponds to a clustering.
#' All vectors should be of the same length.
#' The list itself should usually be named with a suitable label for each clustering.
#' @param prefix Logical scalar indicating whether the cluster levels should be prefixed with its clustering.
#' If \code{clusters} is not named, numeric prefixes are used instead.
#' @param denominator String specifying how the links between clusters should be computed.
#'
#' @details
#' Links are only formed between clusters from different clusterings.
#' The strength of the link between clusters \eqn{X} in clustering 1 and \eqn{Y} in clustering 2
#' is defined from the number of cells with those two labels in their respective clusterings.
#' A larger number of cells indicates that \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} are corresponding clusters.
#'
#' Of course, the number of cells also depends on the total number of cells in each cluster.
#' To account for this, we normalize the strength by a function of the total number of cells in the two clusters.
#' The choice of function is determined by \code{denominator} and determines how the strength is adjusted for dissimilar cluster sizes.
#' \itemize{
#' \item For \code{"min"}, the number of shared cells is divided by the smaller of the totals between the two clusters.
#' \item For \code{"max"}, the number of shared cells is divided by the larger of the totals.
#' \item For \code{"union"}, the number of shared cells is divided by the size of the union.
#' The result is equivalent to the Jaccard index.
#' }
#'
#' In situations where \eqn{X} splits into multiple smaller clusters \eqn{Y1}, \eqn{Y2}, etc. in another clustering,
#' \code{denominator="min"} will report strong links between \eqn{X} and its constituent subclusters.
#' \code{denominator="max"} will report weak links and \code{denominator="union"} will be somewhere in between.
#' Conversely, \code{denominator="max"} forms the strongest links when there is a 1:1 mapping between clusters in different clusterings.
#' This usually yields simpler correspondences between clusterings at the cost of orphaning some of the smaller subclusters.
#'
#' The general idea is to use the graph returned by this function in visualization routines or for community-based clustering,
#' to identify \dQuote{clusters of clusters} that can inform about the relationships between clusterings.
#'
#' @return 
#' A \link{graph} object where each node is a cluster level in one of the clusterings in \code{clusters}.
